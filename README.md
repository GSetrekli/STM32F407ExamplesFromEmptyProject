# STM32F407ExamplesFromEmptyProject
This repository consists of the example codes which writes in register level programming, no third part library. 
SPI,I2C and Uart protocols are between STM32 and arduino or anything else, and this repository just includes the code for stm32f407 discovery board. 
There is no specific drivers for any peripheral, but you can implement this code with structures, drivers. These are basic examples for some peripheral registers.
For coding peripheral register refer to Referance Manual, 
For info about the discovery board, for instance connection leds,buttons on the board, refer to User Manual,
For NVIC register refer to Programming manual(PM0214), 
For alternate function table for GPIO refer to datasheet.
